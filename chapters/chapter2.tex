\section{Self-Adaptive Software Systems}
\label{sec:sas}
In modern-day applications, software complexity has extremely increased thanks to the spread of highly available and faster wireless connection such as in the Internet of Things (IoT) ambit. Since software is often deployed in dynamic contexts, where requirements, environment assumptions and usage profiles varies continuously, software complexity increased over time to the point where it is often composed by a number of sub-components and/or sub-services that work together in order to offer a service to the users. This is the case of service-oriented applications -- also called Service Based Systems (SBS) -- that are composed by multiple \emph{services} and \emph{components}. In these systems, services offered by third-party providers are dynamically composed into workflows to deliver complex functionalities, so SBSs rely on self adaptation to cope with the uncertainties associated with third-party services as the loose coupling of services makes a reconfiguration feasible. Without adaptation, the application is prone to degraded performance  because of faulty components, messages lost between services or delays due to an increasing number of users.

During the past decade a lot of research has been made in this scope but the engineering of adaptive systems remains a incredible challenge.\cite{soft-eng-for-sas-2} In order to solve the problem, \textbf{Self-Adapting Software Systems (SASS)} are born. These are flexible systems that can adapt themselves to their contextual needs and can do so with the highest performance and availability. General discussion concerning the issue and the state of the art in the design and implementation have been presented.\cite{soft-eng-for-sas-2}\cite{survey-aut-comp}\cite{self-adap-soft}\cite{soft-eng-for-sas-1}\cite{soft-eng-for-sas-3}\cite{arch-based-appr-to-sas}\cite{sas-quant-ver} 

These kind of systems have some fundamental properties called auto-managing that are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Auto-configuration
	\item Auto-recovery in case of failure
	\item Auto-optimization
	\item Auto-protection
\end{itemize}
All these properties can be grouped in two more abstract concepts which are self-awareness and context-awareness.

\textbf{Self-Awareness} is the ability of the system to be able to monitor itself in terms of available resources and behavior.

\textbf{Context-Awareness} is the ability of the system to understand the environment where it is working, using the information provided by its components, and adapt itself to all the changes that can occur during its normal operational status.

To better understand how a SASS works we need to answer some simple questions:\linebreak
\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
	\item Who is adapting?
	\item Which adaptation is required?
	\item When is necessary to adapt?
	\item Where is needed to change something
	\item Why is needed an adaptation?
	\item How we achieve this goal?
\end{itemize}

During the past years have been developed some dimensions that help to answer all this simple questions: \emph{Time}, 

\textbf{Who is adapting?} As the name suggests, it's the system itself that changes something in order to preserve some given constraint.
\textbf{Which adaptation is required?} 
\subsection{The SOLAR Framework}
However working on the adaptability of a system can impact other quality attributes such as performance, reliability or maintainability and in the worst case improving adaptability can decrease part, if not all, of these attributes as stated in \cite{bass2003software}: \emph{quality attributes can never be achieved in isolation, the achievement of any one will have an effect, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, on the achievement of others}.

Find a balance between these quality attributes is often a challenging task because sometimes they're conflicting each other, e.g. lower cost and higher availability, so find an adaptability value that can meet all the requisites is, as a consequence, a challenging task too.
